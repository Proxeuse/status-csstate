***Security*** *and* ***Upgrade*** - Due to the fact that PHP version 8.0 will be end of life on November 26th we will migrate all users to the latest PHP version. This will affect everyone on the Plesk server that has PHP enabled for their domain.

All WordPress websites should be updated to the latest version to support the newest PHP version. If Proxeuse built your WordPress website we will make sure it is ready for the upgrade. Other CMS's should also be updated to make sure the new PHP version is supported. We can support you with this.

We will make an extra backup for all sites to prevent data loss. Allow for a downtime of about 60 seconds per website where the PHP version needs to be upgraded. For more information, please contact us.
